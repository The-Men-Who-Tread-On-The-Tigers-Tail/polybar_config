You will need some fonts, so..

```
font-0 = agaveNerdFont:size=14;3
font-1 = MaterialSymbolsRounded:size=18;2
font-2 = monospace:size=14;1
```

Also to setup the lock, logout.. actions and the menu used is rofi.
(Btw. there is also a rose pine theme for rofi.)

You also have to setup your own mpd server and client..

And here is the dawn version:
